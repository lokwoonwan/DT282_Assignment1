My assignment is on Beijingâ€™s air pollution. Data is taken from the US Government.
In my CSV file, it shows the level of pollution at an hourly rate in April 2014.
I use an arrayList and class to retrieve my data and apply it to my graphs.

I have taken the hourly rates and got the average value for each day.


I have created a menu using a switch statement. My menu has an image background with snowflakes falling (because CHRISTMAS). I used a class to create the snowflakes called fallingStar.

My first graph is a trend graph. It represents the fluctuations in the air pollution in Beijing. You can see clearly what the highest and lowest pollution was in the month of April. You are able to see the exact mpg/m^3 when you hover over the graph line.

My second graph is a donut graph. From this graph, it is very easy to see what the average amount of air pollution is. The graph is colour coordinated so you can see if Beijing's air pollution is unsafe, moderate or safe on average at a glance.



// In my comments, I do have a third method called smog(). It is something that I would like to work on in my spare time. Please ignore it.
